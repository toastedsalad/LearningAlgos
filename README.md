# Arrays

Array is a continuous space of memory.
So usually you have to tell the compiler how to interpret it.
In other words it's just memory and you have to tell to the computer what it is.

In JavaScript you can have an ArrayBuffer that you can later mold into different things.

You can then tell that this ArrayBuffer should be viewed as 1 byte array. And then also view the same array as a 2byte array.

It's a good example to think about because of how memory works. In a six byte array we can place six 1 byte integers or 3 two byte integers.
